CLARITY: The plot is very easy to read. It's well-symbolized and has all the appropriate units. It's in logscale, though, so the scale may be somewhat confusing for a lay audience.

AESTHETICS: The aesthetics of the plot serve it well. The colors are clear, and the gray background is unobtrusive. The scale lines are helpful for determining value specifics. Nothing appears to be overtly distracting.

HONESTY: The data is presented in logscale, probably because the base values were tightly clustered. This isn't necessarily a problem, but the axes don't start at 0.

SUGGESTIONS:
    -The size of the circles might be a better fit to population size of a city, rather than density. I would symbolize density with colors instead.
    -Using both color and size would be a good way to symbolize both population size and density.
    -Consider putting axis lines were x=0 and y=0.
