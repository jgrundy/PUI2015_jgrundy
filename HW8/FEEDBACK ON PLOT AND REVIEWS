NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
=================


the plot is clear, colorblind compliant

consider a compressed notation for both axes: riders in units of 10,000 and res housing in units of 10,000 as well.

the line fits are too thin and at the edge of visibility




NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
==================================

ama908
======
the differences year by year are tiny so it is hard to understand why they are highlighted as they are by color: it is what draws most of the attention and it is not the message that tries to be conveyed. 

axis labels too small

the units on the y axis should be compresses: use tens of thousands and plot single digit numbers

colors are lost by the 10% of the population that is color blind that cannot tell the difference between 2007 and 2008 etc

carlylecdavis
=============
compact visualization that summarized a lot of the data structure. 

however there is a conceptual problem for this plot when it is used for a time series rather than categories. the reader is invariably given the impression that finance (blue here) lags behind in time w respect to the yellow category. this is the wrong (and in fact meaningless) impression but it is distracting.

y label ambiguous

what year are we referring to? include in title

a legend should tell whether the dotted and dashed lines are the mean or the median and the quirtiles or what else, though that can also be included in the caption.


livenlulu
=========

nice simple plot

too much empty space on the top: distracting (and even on the left)

small tick labels
