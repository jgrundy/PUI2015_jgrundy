For question 1, much of the extraneous material was removed from the provided notebook, leaving just the relevant code for each distribution. Each distribution was run in its own cell, with universal variables and packages getting their own cells as well. Then, the histogram with the merged data was done at the end.

For question 2, the relevant cells were filled out, and the notebook was otherwise unchanged.

There is no special instructions for running either one. They should run fine with standard packages.
