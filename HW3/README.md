For question 1, much of the extraneous material was removed from the provided notebook, leaving just the relevant code for
each distribution. Each distribution was run in its own cell, with universal variables and packages getting their own cells
as well. Then, the histogram with the merged data was done at the end.

For question 2, the relevant cells were filled out, and the notebook was otherwise unchanged.

Both of the files are either in this folder, or may be in the root PU2015_jgrundy directory. They are:
